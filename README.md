## dbt models to test parent details macro(s)

### What is this?
* Based on [this discussion](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C0VLZPLAE/p1519866500000202), I had a go at writing some macros for parent/child relationships. 
* I've included seed files so that the examples work

### Instructions
```
$ dbt seed
$ dbt run
```
